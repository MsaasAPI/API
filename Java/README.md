Java is one of the most popular general-purpose computer-programming languages. We attempt to provide user-friendly step-by-step reference for the readers to get started smoothly and hence shorten the on-boarding process. The intended audience is the web developers.

If the reader would like to follow this guide, but does not have experience with VS Code, [Get Started](https://github.com/MsaasAPI/API/wiki/Get-Started-with-VS-Code-for-Java) section provides a good starting point to configure the Java environment in VS Code. On the other hand, regardless the IDE choice, setting up Java keystore will be required to implement AAD authentication in Java, and [Set Up Keystore](https://github.com/MsaasAPI/API/wiki/Set-up-SSL-Keystore-for-Java-Case-API-Application) will come in handy in this regard. Once this piece is in place, the reader will be ready to install the sample application. Either [One-Pager Sample App](https://github.com/MsaasAPI/API/wiki/Java-VS-Code-Case-API-Single-Page-Console-Application) or [SOLID Sample App](https://github.com/MsaasAPI/API/wiki/Java-VS-Code-Case-API-SOLID-Console-Application) shall help.
